def gcd_for_numpy_array(arr: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in a NumPy array.

    The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers
    in the array without a remainder.

    Args:
        arr: A NumPy array of integers. It can contain positive, negative,
             or zero values. The array must not be empty.
             If the array is multi-dimensional, it will be flattened first.

    Returns:
        An integer representing the greatest common divisor of the elements.
        - If the array (after flattening) contains only zeros, the GCD is 0.
        - If the array contains zeros and non-zero numbers, the GCD is that
          of the non-zero numbers.
        - The result is always non-negative.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input array `arr` is empty (i.e., arr.size == 0).
        TypeError: If the array does not contain integer types that np.gcd can handle
                   (this error is usually propagated from the underlying np.gcd ufunc).

    # The `initial=0` argument is crucial:
    # 1. It provides a starting value for the accumulation.
    # 2. np.gcd(0, x) returns abs(x) (for integer x). This ensures that:
    #    - For a single element array [n] (after flattening), it effectively computes gcd(0, n) = |n|.
    #    - It correctly handles initial zeros in the flattened array.
    # np.gcd ufunc inherently returns non-negative results (or 0 if both inputs are 0).
