# shturkhal-gauss-rabbit-algorithm
Shturkhal-Gauss-Rabbit algorithm for solving Frobenius coin problem.

## Shturkhal-Gauss-Rabbit algorithm v. 6 brief analysis:
* Time complexity is the (Frobenius number) * (modulus);
* Memory requirements is (modulus);

## v. 6 updates:
* replaced try...except with get;
* replaced heap priority queue with Tim Sort priority queue;
* added congruences with (residues, Apery set, related zeros) as output;

## Notes:
* Algorithm is based on Shturkhal-Gauss-Rabbit graph linearization;
* Algorithm works with (coefficients set length) > 1 and gcd(coefficients set) = 1.

## Related problems:
* Hamiltonian Path;
* Travelling Salesman;
